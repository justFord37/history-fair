            <p> On the fateful day September 11, 2001, business was as usual in New York City; people were heading to work, kids
                 were at school and all was well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Column2">
            <p>Then at 8:46AM American Airlines Flight 11 was flying unusually low and crashed intothe North Tower at the World Trade 
                Center in Manhattan. While eveyone was confused, another plane ht the South Tower at 9:03AM. At this point it was 
                clear this calamity wasn't an accident... it was an attack! Just over 30 minutes later another American Airlines flight 
                crashed into the Pentagon. Thanks to a group of passengers, a plane targeting another government building in D.C was 
                overtaken and crashed in Pennslyvania.

            <p> Just a little less than an hour later, the North Tower fell as a result of the melted metal, followed by the South 
                Tower not too long after. After the dust settled the city looked devastated. The final death count was 2,996 people.
