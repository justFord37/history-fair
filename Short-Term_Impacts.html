            <p> The people responsible for the attacks were traced to a terrorist group called Al Qaeda, who believed the United States
                was a threat to Islamic culture. The American airspace was immediately closed to all commercial flights and Operation 
                Enduring Freedom began, initiating the War on Terror. Airport security in the days and weeks afer was insanely tight
                and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was founded a couple months after.
