            <p> The War on Terror is still on going long after the leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was killed. The US has soldiers 
                in Afghanistan for just over 20 years before they were asked to return. Because the group responsible for the attacks
                were from the Middle East there was unnecessary hate directed toward all ethnicities rooted there. It was mainly directed
                toward Muslims.</p>

            <p> The many years of military invovlement from the U.S. has seen some mixed reactions and controversey from both the
                people of Afghanistan and ourselves. Our mission to stop Al Qaeda succeeded but our mission to end terrorism didn't 
                necessarily fail, but has taken a pause.
